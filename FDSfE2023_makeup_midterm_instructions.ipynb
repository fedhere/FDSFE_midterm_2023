        "\n",
        "Sea level rise, associated with global warming, is a threat to people living in costal areas and to world sustainability. Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers, and the expansion of seawater as it warms. The [data you are given access to is from NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/), which tracks the change in global sea level since 1993, as observed by satellites.\n",
